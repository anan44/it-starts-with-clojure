# It Starts With Clojure: a Practical guide to Clojure

This a guide (something between a tiny book and a course) how to get started with Clojure.
The actual reading materials are under **./materials/** where they are grouped by sections.
Materials are in Markdown so you can easily read the directly from GitHub,
or you can fork the repo to your own computer and make notes while reading.
When you come across a section that you feel has issues or could be somehow better,
feel free to make pull requests or issues out of them.

The goal is to add materials, projects and exercises to this project,
so it can be used as perfect getting started point for to-be-clojurists.
